# Overview 

This worksheet is designed to help your open source project team have
meaningful conversations about security practices. By working through these
questions together, you'll identify potential security gaps and develop a more
security-conscious mindset across your team. [^1]

**Setting aside a one to two hour conversation with your team would be a
good start at bringing more of a security mindset.** The below worksheet can
walk a team through security considerations and ways in which the team feels
vulnerable / exposed.
