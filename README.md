A worksheet to help start security discussions on OSS projects

The Secuirty Mindsets Worksheet is a resource you can bring to your open source project to help catalyze a conversation around security and the security mindsets among participants in the conversation. It is not a security system, it is not a set of security practices, it is a conversation starter. A first step to help survey the landscape and explore ways in which your project can work to share a joint conversation about the security practices of the project.

We have it available as a [PDF](https://github.com/eoss-om-communitycalls/2025-05-22-security-mindsets-worksheet/blob/main/worksheet_securitymindsets.pdf) and as a [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19557u1Bb81zr4cNDMamjejbLBNTdt5XzowjQ8UJiyMg/edit?tab=t.0) which you can [make a copy of](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19557u1Bb81zr4cNDMamjejbLBNTdt5XzowjQ8UJiyMg/copy) to use for running a 1-2 hour workshop. Note that there is some pre-work to consider before you launch into a workshop to help you think through some big picture things around your project's security outlook.
